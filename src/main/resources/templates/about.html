        Panda Show was born from a simple statement, TV shows have taken a huge spot in our lives but with the flow of
        our lives it's not always easy to catch up. The more shows you watch the more easy it is to get mixed up between
        seasons, episodes or even shows. Our goal at <strong>Panda Show</strong> is to help you keep in touch with your
        shows, whenever, wherever.
